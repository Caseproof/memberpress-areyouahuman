MemberPress Are You a Human Add-On
==================================

Enforces an "Are You a Human" game on each registration page. This does the same thing as a Captcha but much less annoying.

Here are the steps to get working with MemberPress:

1. Go to [AreYouAHuman.com](http://areyouahuman.com/ "AreYouAHuman.com") and register for a free account. Make sure you select "Not Listed" as your platform.
2. Install MemberPress Are You A Human Add-On alongside MemberPress on your WordPress website
3. Copy your Publisher and Scoring keys: ![Copy your keys](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/bb5f3d70-f66c-4989-ad10-62342edbeec6/4a68cab3189c15d976157df75ed88cb3/deep/0/Dashboard%20%C2%BB%20Are%20You%20A%20Human.png)
4. Go to "MemberPress" -> "Options" -> "General" -> "Are You A Human"

That's it ... now an "Are You a Human" box should appear after the first screen in the registration process.
